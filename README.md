fun game
Each round the computer will make a prediction of which type of Pokémon the user will
choose, Fire, Water, or Grass. Based on this prediction the computer then chooses a
Pokémon that will beat the user’s choice. Fire beats Grass, Grass beats Water, and Water
beats Fire. The user selects their Pokémon and then the computer’s choice is revealed. A
point is given to the winner and the game repeats until the user decides to quit.
